# AWS can sink us

AWS is a very popular cloud provider with almost unlimited scale thus Hashnode running on it. The problem is that the more we depend on AWS the more we suffer if it get a data breach or a outage. Vultr, DigitalOcean and Linode they are solid platforms but they do not have a near-unlimited scale like AWS does and the servers can be expensive if you are on a very strict budget or hate managing servers. 

The good options:

- 
[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/stardust-instances/) is doing 10 % pricing increases. On the really large VPS plans/dedicated server plans there is no pricing change from PRO2-L to PRO2-XXS server plans.

- 
[Railway](https://railway.app/) is giving you a completely free managed docker hosting and free databases that are free up to 5 USD. They run on Google Cloud Platform, Their only region is in the west coast of the US, so if you are located somewhere else the latency may be increased

- 
[Fly.io](https://fly.io/) is similar to Railway but you can choose your region and all of their regions are privately owned instead of running on a cloud provider.

- 
[Njala](https://njal.la/) is pricey but ultra-private no bullshit cloud provider based in Sweden that providers Domains (that it gets from another registrar but it gives you all the ownership of the domain), VPSes that have scanning and smtp blocked and a VPN that has WireGuard and OpenVPN with a good reputation of protecting privacy due to the company being launched in 2009
