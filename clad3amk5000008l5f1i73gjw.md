# How to cryptomine Monero

[Bitcoin](https://www.highperformancecpmgate.com/xgtttt6rw?key=505620555b8a717ec8e84c963595f0e9) and [Etherium](https://www.highperformancecpmgate.com/xgtttt6rw?key=505620555b8a717ec8e84c963595f0e9) is crashing but a couple of coins like XMR are stable despite every coin being literally on fire. [Monero](https://www.highperformancecpmgate.com/xgtttt6rw?key=505620555b8a717ec8e84c963595f0e9) can be a investment (this is not professional advice and i am not a investor) when Bitcoin, Etherium and Zcash falls, then its stock price maybe rises and the coins worth rises.

In this blog post we will be setting up a Monero wallet and setting up [Crypto](https://www.highperformancecpmgate.com/xgtttt6rw?key=505620555b8a717ec8e84c963595f0e9) mining software. First on your Android phone go install [this wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cakewallet.cake_wallet) from Google Play Store and set up a crypto account there. Save the memonic seed and the blockheight so you can set up your wallet on your PC or recover it after a data loss.

Now on with the mining! You can choose 2 paths, Mining on your main PC or mining on a separate PC. I recommend using [RagerX](https://monero.ragerx.lol/) for the separate Laptop/PC because it can make your Hashrate higher because it is the only application running on the PC and the PC is not needing to execute any other application else than the cryptomining software required for the task. RagerX can be installed to a PC/Laptop using their [Windows](https://dl.ragerx.lol/ragerx-flasher-utility-windows-x64-v1.0.5.exe)/[Linux](https://dl.ragerx.lol/ragerx-flasher-utility-linux-x64-v1.0.5.tar.xz) clients where you can set up your wallet address to be hard-coded into the ISO. With addition to mining you can also track the hash-rate and control the different mining PCs using the [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/).

Mining on a PC mostly includes in [downloading XMRig](https://xmrig.com/download) and configuring a wallet address and pool to mine in. Pools are gangs of other computers sharing a very large and hard mathematical puzzle with the other computers in the pool.
Larger pools have the most difficult puzzles and the most control. [Nanopool](https://nanopool.org/) validates 21.82% of all the transactions on the Monero blockchain. If the hash-rate becomes too high then they can control and validate most of the transactions owning the pool to controls what transactions go into the Blockchain.

[Blockchain](https://www.highperformancecpmgate.com/xgtttt6rw?key=505620555b8a717ec8e84c963595f0e9) is a large log of all the transactions on a cryptocurrency that consists of growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.

Extract the zip file to a empty directory then go to [this website](https://xmrig.com/wizard) and complete the wizard. Copy the config in the website into your config and open the executable with administrator privileges. Now you are mining cryptocurrency!  Type the letter "h" to show your hashrate 

```
1 KH/s = 1000 Hashes per second
1 MH/s = 1000 Kilohashes
1 GH/s = 1000 Megahashes
1 TH/s = 1000 Gigahashes
```
