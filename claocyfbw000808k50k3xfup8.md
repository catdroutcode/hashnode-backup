# Let's Encrypt will decrypt the web

Let's Encrypt is a certificate authority issuing free domain validated TLS certificates for more than 300 Million websites. This blog uses Let's Encrypt for SSL infact.

> The power of the web is not in centralization; it's not in closed systems or anything like that. It's in its open nature, and that's what allowed it to flourish for the first 10 or 15 years. - Matt Mullenweg

Free is not always better. Fraudsters are using Let's Encrypt to give users a fake impression that their "scam" site is very secure and legit. We need to make HTTPS sites have a neutral color on the padlock to indicate that the website's connection is secure but the content on the site is not always safe. 

SSL certificates prove sites that they have not been compromised and one entity shall not control the trust. Instead we need to federate the trust of securing sites to multiple entities instead of just one. 

Imagine if Let's Encrypt gets hacked? All the 300 million certificates are at risk!
