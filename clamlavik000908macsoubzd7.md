# You will never succeed in Search Engine Optimization

Search Engine optimization is good, it brings people to view your content.
Unfortunately you will never succeed in SEO because the companies are winning the attention of search engines. Getting peoples attention is very hard to get, Its pay to win. More money in Ads = more page views. Does not matter if you produce the most up to date high quality content, Google and Bing only care about money not your feelings.

The only way out of this hell is to create a anti SEO content search engine that punishes companies and only allows individuals and non profits to post. All sites are getting monitored so no site gets too densely visited
