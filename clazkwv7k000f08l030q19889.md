# How i cryptomine with Internet

Cryptocurrencies are pretty hard to mine, They take a lot of energy because computing SHA256 hashes is very CPU intensive. In a couple places in the world electricity is so expensive if you would cryptomine on it one could get arrested. 

What if we instead of computing hashes we could share Internet! Mysterium is a cryptocurrency where you host a server somewhere On-prem or in the cloud and you share internet bandwidth with people in authoritarian countries like Russia and receive MYST tokens which you can deposit in a Etherium wallet and earn some Cash.
Sharing Internet actually is pretty good for the environment because you share the unused resources you don't use.
