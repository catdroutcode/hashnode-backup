# Hashnode is creepy

Hashnode is a good blogging plattform but you should reconsider it due to horrible privacy. 
**Hashnode privacy policy**
Information we collect (3)
```Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.``` 

- probably some google analytics but still pretty concerning

```The information we collect automatically is only statistical data and does not include personal information, but we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve the Websites and Service and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:``` 

- They build stats of your data and they will associate that data with other data. Pretty sus

```For any other purpose with your consent``` 

- So hashnode can assasinate me with my consent ðŸ˜†

```[We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to our advertisers' target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your personal information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.]``` 

- they lied they do have ads

```We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:

To our subsidiaries and affiliates.
To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Hashnode's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Hashnode about our Websitesâ€™ users is among the assets transferred.
To third parties (collectively, the "Third Party Vendors") to further the purpose for which you provided such information to us. For example, we may share your information our email platform, for the purpose of sending emails or with other vendors for the purposes of payment processing, delivery of goods, search engine facilities, advertising and marketing.
To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
With your consent.```

- They share your personal data with 3rd parties and with anyone if they go broke or get bought 


Conclusion: Hashnodes privacy policy is equal to Google's. You can continue to use Hashnode but block all their trackers
