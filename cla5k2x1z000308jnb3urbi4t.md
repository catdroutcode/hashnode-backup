# You should not make a website

Websites are a money waste. If you decide to make a website for any purpose other than making money you are basically wasting your money on web hosting (with no guarantees) your readers will donate and web hosting costs money so its mostly a win lose situation. Your readers will see your content for free but you will be just a small step closer to live on the streets. If you set up a paywall people will just leave your website because everyone is poor except if you work at Google with a 900 0000$ salary. So your only option is to leave the web and live on the forests [(like these people do)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d09ekflENVQ).
