# Hashnode should add support for exporting entire blogs not just posts

Hashnode is good, almost no lock in, no ads, custom domain amazing but when you export your blog you only get the posts not the blog so if you would like to migrate your blog to for example Cloudflare Pages (many PoPs, free) you would need to try to clone the Hashnode UI and functionality and possibly get a cease and desist.

It would be cool if we could export the Next.js blogs Hashnode gives us, or at least a ability to have a different cloud hosting our valuable posts
